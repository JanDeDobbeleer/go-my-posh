A package that installs the Oh my Posh executable using [Homebrew][brew].

:::caution Font icons
For maximum enjoyment, make sure to **install** and **configure** your terminal to use a powerline enabled font.
The fonts we use are patched by [Nerd Fonts][nerdfonts], which offer a maximum of icons you can use to configure your prompt.
To easily find the icon you want, have a look at their [cheat sheet][nf-cheat].

## Installation

```bash
brew tap jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh
brew install oh-my-posh
```

This installs two things:

-  `oh-my-posh` - Executable, added to `/usr/local/bin`
-  `themes` - The latest Oh my Posh themes

If you want to use a standard theme, you can find them in `$(brew --prefix oh-my-posh)/themes`, referencing them as such
will always keep them compatible with the binary when updating Oh my Posh.

## Update

```bash
brew upgrade oh-my-posh
```
